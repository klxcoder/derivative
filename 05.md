# Problem
  - $y = xw + b$
  - Find $dy/dw$ and $dy/db$
  - Where $x$, $y$, $w$, $b$ are matrices

# Solution
  - $dy/dw = x^T$ (Where $x^T$ is the transpose of x)
  - $dy/db = 1$ (or more precisely, a `matrix of ones` with the same number of rows as $y$, but since $b$ is usually a vector, $dy/db$ is a `vector of ones`)

# Real matrices
